# How to add the custom pot file #

Download and extract this folder --> Open LTSpice --> Open or New Schematic --> Tools (Home Bar) --> Control Panel --> "Sim. & Lib. Search Paths" --> Copy the location of the directory to the folder containing the .asc and .asy files to that textbox --> Component Library should now have your folder saved as library and you can add the potentiometer

# Adjust Wiper #

Right click part --> edit the PARAMS field where "R = 100k val = 50" --> adjust val between 1-99 for 1% and 99% of the wiper --> can also check "PARAMS" box to show on schematic" --> click "OK"

I think you can also adjust the total value of the potentiometer changing "R=" field but I haven't checked
