# Sim #
All simulations are in the .asc format which can be run in LTSpice XVII

# 555_Timer_10V #
The voltage divider will be replaced with a potentiometer to adjust the Duty Cycle. Adjusting the duty cycle via the potentiometer will change the output voltage (larger duty cycle = larger output V)

# Boost Converter #
Can't really simulate the characteristics of the rectifier source and its ripple voltage without a the rectifier circuit, boost converter produces the desired DC output, needs to be simulated with the rectifier
